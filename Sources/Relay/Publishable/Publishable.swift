/// A macro that adds ``Publishable-protocol`` conformance to `Observable` types.
///
/// - Note: This macro infers the global actor isolation of the type and applies it to the generated declarations.
/// If this causes compilation errors, use ``Publishable(isolation:)`` instead.
///
/// - Note: This macro works only with `final` classes to which the `Observable` or `SwiftData.Model` macro has been applied directly.
///
/// The `Publishable` macro adds a new `publisher` property to your type,
/// which exposes `Combine` publishers for all mutable or computed instance properties.
///
/// If a property’s type conforms to `Equatable`, its publisher automatically removes duplicate values.
/// Just like the `Published` property wrapper, subscribing to any of the exposed publishers immediately emits the current value.
///
/// - Important: Swift Macros do not have access to full type information of expressions used in the code they’re applied to.
/// Since working with `Combine` requires knowledge of concrete types, this macro attempts to infer the types of properties when they are not explicitly specified.
/// However, this inference may fail in non-trivial cases. If the generated code fails to compile, explicitly specifying the type of the affected property should resolve the issue.
